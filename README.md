## Introduction ##

Our team is creating an application for the Texas A&M Obstacle Course Racing (TAMUOCR) organization. This application will enable each member to keep track of their own individual progress by logging in their personal times as well as record their completion of a particular workout. In addition, members will also be able to compare their personal record times by viewing a daily/weekly leaderboard. Members will also have the option of liking or “fistbumping” other members’ workout results as well as being able to favorite certain workouts.

## Environmental Variables/Files ##

Google OAuth2 support requires two keys to function as intended: Client ID and Client Secret

Create a new file called application.yml in the /config folder and add the following lines:

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE'`

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'`


## Deployment ##

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo

--------

To add enviornment variables to enable google oauth2 functionality, head over to the settings tab on the pipeline dashboard

Scroll down until `Reveal config vars`

Add both your client id and your secret id, with fields `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively

Now once your pipeline has built the apps, select `Open app` to open the app

With the staging app, if you would like to move the app to production, click the two up and down arrows and select `Move to production`

And now your application is setup and in production mode!
